Autonomous-Sailboat
===================

My internship deals with this problem of controlling sailboat robots, which I am working on with the University of Plymouth. The first part of this internship consists of making a numerical simulation on a computer. The ROS middleware and its graphical visualization tool were used to perform this simulation. The developed code was written in C++.


Getting Started
---------------

This repository is a ROS package. Here is a quick description of the folders.

* ***launch*** : launch file allowed to run ros node.
* ***meshs*** : CAO files
* ***src*** : Scripts contained in this repository


Use this package
----------------

1. Create a ROS workspace ***mkdir -p ~/workspaceRos/src, cd ~/workspaceRos, catkin_make***.
2. In a terminal under workspaceRos/src, type ***git clone https://github.com/mamadouDembele/sailboat.git***
3. Finally type ***echo "source ~/workspaceRos/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc***
You now have the package installed in ***workspaceRos/src/sailboat***.
